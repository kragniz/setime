How to set up:

1) Set up ssh hosts by adding a host called `pi` to ~/.ssh/config on your local
machine. Example (assuming your pi is located at 192.168.1.2):

    Host pi
        HostName 192.168.1.2
        User pi

2) Add your ssh key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the pi

    ssh pi "echo $(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

3) All done! run `./setime` to sync clocks
